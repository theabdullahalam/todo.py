# Pure Python todo.txt Implementation
An implementation of the non-nonsense todo.txt format in a single file python script with no third party libraries. I needed one to allow me to maintain a todo.txt per project, and decided to write this.

It isn't as exhaustive as the popular [todo.txt-cli,](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli) but it gets the job done.
